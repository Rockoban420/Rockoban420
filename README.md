### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my github profile!

- ðŸ”­ I graduated the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp and now im teaching myself web design and animations. My main area of expertise is the MEARN stack with React and graphQL 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working for an early stage startup parenteai.com as a Front End Developer. I was also hired as a Instructional Specialist at the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp by 2U

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email address is lautaro.avellaneda@gmail.com 

- âš¡ Fun fact: My javascript skills are top notch. In high school I participated in extra classes for C++ and learned very in depth sorting algorithms and Dijkstra with nodes so starting on Javascript was like a walk in the park. Back-end server handling was a challenge and I have been loving every second of it. I cant wait to put my skills and knowledge to the test

- ðŸ”¥ Other projects I worked on with teams: 
Chirper (Fullstack social media app) https://github.com/zelada5574/SocialMediagang 
Hotel lookup with google maps API and priceline API: https://github.com/SamanthaJoy13/so_youre_looking_for_a_hotel
