### Hi there 👋 welcome to my github profile!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Coding Bootcamp and I've been having the most AMAZING time our teacher is incredibly smart and easy to follow and have been learning and picking up new technologies every week now working on back-end and our second project!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build full-stack applications with node handlebars logic and RESTful APIs using express and MySQL

- 📫 How to reach me: My email address is lautaro.avellaneda@gmail.com 

- ⚡ Fun fact: My javascript skills are top notch. In high school I participated in extra classes for C++ and learned very in depth sorting algorithms and Dijkstra with nodes so starting on Javascript was like a walk in the park. Back-end server handling was a challenge and I have been loving every second of it. I cant wait to put my skills and knowledge to the test

- 🔥 Other projects I worked on with teams: 
Chirper (Fullstack social media app) https://github.com/zelada5574/SocialMediagang 
Hotel lookup with google maps API and priceline API: https://github.com/SamanthaJoy13/so_youre_looking_for_a_hotel
